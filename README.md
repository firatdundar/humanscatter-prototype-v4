Humanscatter v4 is an **enhanced version** of the [original Humanscatter project](https://github.com/amau75/Humanscatter), developed as part of a **summer research internship** at **RISE Research Institutes of Sweden**.  
This work focuses on **improving the range, reliability, and power stability** of a **low-power backscatter wireless communication prototype** for battery-free IoT applications.

## What's New in Humanscatter v4

### **v4.1**
- **Carrier module upgraded** to an **ADF4351 RF synthesizer** instead of CC2500.
- Added **AMS1117 3.3 V LDO regulator** for **cleaner and more stable power**.
- Improved range thanks to **better carrier control** and lower noise.
- Redesigned **KiCad PCB design** and updated **Raspberry Pi Pico firmware**.

### **v4.2**
- Built on top of v4.1 enhancements.
- **Receiver module upgraded** to a **CC2500 EMK evaluation kit**.
- Switched from a **trace antenna** to an **SMA-based external antenna** for better sensitivity.
- **AMS1117 regulator retained** for stable RF power delivery.
- Further improved range, carrier stability, and signal reliability.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/humanscatter-v4.git
cd humanscatter-v4
````

### 2. Open KiCad Project

```bash
cd humanscatter-v4.1/kicad
open humanscatter-v4.1.kicad_pro
```

*(Same for `humanscatter-v4.2`.)*

### 3. Build and Flash Firmware

* Follow the same steps as in the [original Humanscatter project](https://github.com/amau75/Humanscatter).
* Replace the firmware files with the updated ones provided in the **`firmware/`** folder.
* Flash the code to the **Raspberry Pi Pico** using **Thonny** or any other MicroPython flashing tool.

##  Experimental Improvements

The key goals of this research were to **improve range**, **stability**, and **power delivery**.
Using the **ADF4351 RF synthesizer**, **AMS1117 regulator**, and an **SMA-based CC2500 EMK receiver**:

* Achieved **greater link distance** compared to original version.
* Improved **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)**.
* Reduced **carrier frequency drift**.
* Increased **overall communication reliability**.
